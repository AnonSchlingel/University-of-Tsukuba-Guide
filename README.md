**DISCLAIMER:** We recommend leaving without expectations; it's not like in anime. There are positives and negatives to being in Japan. It is an extremely civilized country, but very attached to traditions. Few speak English; at least learn the alphabet. Respect the rules and live the culture to the fullest; it's different; everything is different. We recommend immersing yourself in nature, seeing the temples, talking to the locals, and not being the classic tourist at Disney World or Universal Studio (not that there is anything bad, but there is much better).

At least we did it that way, and it was beautiful.

## Before leaving

| **Money**                     | You can order Money from your bank before leaving (we recommend about a thousand Euro in Yen), but if you don’t arrive with already exchanged money and you have a lot of cash with you, you can also exchange it right at the airport. The exchange rate is pretty up-to date with almost no fees at all, but always check the course [online](https://www.xe.com/de/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=EUR&To=JPY) first.<br/><br/>On campus in front of the university hall, there is an [ATM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qzk82wrbteD6jRtY9) for just-in-case withdrawals. You can also find ATMs in nearly every convenience store or supermarket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Internet**              | Getting a SIM-Card can be quite confusing. [This Website](https://prepaid-data-sim-card.fandom.com/wiki/Japan) can be very helpful in getting an overview of the topic. If you feel lazy and are fine without mobile internet for the first few days, it might be best to just ask your tutor about helping you out  getting a good SIM-Card. If you're lazy, but you want mobile data right from the get-go and can accept not having a Japanese phone number, then you might have a look into [Nippon SIM](https://en.nipponsim.jp/about), which is one of the cheapest options out there. They offer [eSIM-Plans](https://en.nipponsim.jp/esimplan) as well as normal SIM-Cards (of which we used [this one](https://en.nipponsim.jp/product-page/dha-sim-132)). You can also let them get delivered to your airport on the day you arrive. There are different options, of which you can choose the one that works best for you. Aside from only a few outages (which never lasted more than a few hours), we were pretty fine with these SIM-Cards, but you might have a look at other providers and options as well. |
| **Desaster Preventation** | Since Japan is one of the most earthquake-active countries in the world, it is advisable to get [NERV](https://nerv.app/en/) on your smartphone. It’s a free app that informs you, depending on your current location, about disaster prevention information, real-time earthquake early warnings, tsunami warnings and keeps you updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
