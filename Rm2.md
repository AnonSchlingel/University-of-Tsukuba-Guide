**DISCLAIMER:** We recommend leaving without expectations; it's not like in anime. There are positives and negatives to being in Japan. It is an extremely civilized country, but very attached to traditions. Few speak English; at least learn the alphabet. Respect the rules and live the culture to the fullest; it's different; everything is different. We recommend immersing yourself in nature, seeing the temples, talking to the locals, and not being the classic tourist at Disney World or Universal Studio (not that there is anything bad, but there is much better).

At least we did it that way, and it was beautiful.

## Before leaving

|                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Money**                     | You can order Money from your bank before leaving (we recommend about a thousand Euro in Yen), but if you don’t arrive with already exchanged money and you have a lot of cash with you, you can also exchange it right at the airport. The exchange rate is pretty up-to date with almost no fees at all, but always check the course [online](https://www.xe.com/de/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=EUR&To=JPY) first.<br/><br/>On campus in front of the university hall, there is an [ATM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qzk82wrbteD6jRtY9) for just-in-case withdrawals. You can also find ATMs in nearly every convenience store or supermarket.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Internet**              | Getting a SIM-Card can be quite confusing. [This Website](https://prepaid-data-sim-card.fandom.com/wiki/Japan) can be very helpful in getting an overview of the topic. If you feel lazy and are fine without mobile internet for the first few days, it might be best to just ask your tutor about helping you out  getting a good SIM-Card. If you're lazy, but you want mobile data right from the get-go and can accept not having a Japanese phone number, then you might have a look into [Nippon SIM](https://en.nipponsim.jp/about), which is one of the cheapest options out there. They offer [eSIM-Plans](https://en.nipponsim.jp/esimplan) as well as normal SIM-Cards (of which we used [this one](https://en.nipponsim.jp/product-page/dha-sim-132)). You can also let them get delivered to your airport on the day you arrive. There are different options, of which you can choose the one that works best for you. Aside from only a few outages (which never lasted more than a few hours), we were pretty fine with these SIM-Cards, but you might have a look at other providers and options as well. |
| **Desaster Preventation** | Since Japan is one of the most earthquake-active countries in the world, it is advisable to get [NERV](https://nerv.app/en/) on your smartphone. It’s a free app that informs you, depending on your current location, about disaster prevention information, real-time earthquake early warnings, tsunami warnings and keeps you updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Socket Adapter**        | You’ll need a Type A - SE adapter, in order to use your typical EU and Type F (Schuko) plugs. You can buy these easily at the airport after arriving in Japan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Communication**         | The most used messenger among the Japanese is [LINE](https://line.me/en/). If you get a SIM-Card without a phone number, make sure, you create an account in your home country. <br/><br/>[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com) is probably the most used messenger among the exchange students.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [**Academic calendar**](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/academics/academic-calendar/index.html)     | We suggest to always check, since there are many national holidays here (luckily shops won’t close on most of them and convenience stores will always be open).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Lessons/ Courses: How to look for it**                                                         | The semester is split up into A, B and C parts. Some courses won’t be offered throughout the whole semester (actually, most of them). So, for example, some courses might only be offered in A and B, while others might  be held just in C. In order to keep your Visa you need to have an average amount of 8 periods per week (it’s on you in how you achieve that). Jukebox is the easiest-to-navigate system for finding courses, while KDB offers a more complete selection. Mostly all courses will be held in Japanese, even though the course description says English. If you’re struggling to find enough courses or just want some easy ones, and you don’t mind sports, take Volleyball or other sport courses. They have a big selection, and even if it’s not your field of study, these periods will count as ones of the 8 necessary periods. The same is true for taking masters (graduate) courses as a bachelors (undergraduate) student, but you won’t get credits for those. It also might be more difficult to enroll in these, but it sure is possible. <br/><br/>Also: The courses that you choose at the time of application can be changed. Some of them might not even be offered when the semester actually starts. Don’t stress out about it too much, you’ll have a few weeks of time after the classes start to register everything. |
| [**Academic calendar**](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/academics/academic-calendar/index.html)     | We suggest to always check, since there are many national holidays here (luckily shops won’t close on most of them and convenience stores will always be open).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Living Vegan/Vegetarian/Gluten Free 

It's not that easy to be living with some kind of food restriction in Japan, since even the most inconspicuous-looking food could contain some form of meat or gluten. Overall, cooking yourself is the easiest version of getting food that is suitable for you (as long as you stay away from processed food).

If you still want to go out for food, Indian/Nepalese restaurants are one of the easiest places to get meatless food, since they're always offering at least vegetarian curries. Then there are [Happy Cow](https://www.happycow.net) and [Vegewel](https://vegewel.com/en/) that can help you search for restaurants with vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options in not just Tsukuba, but also the whole of Japan.

#### **Our favorites in Tsukuba are:**

- [Jewel of India](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8qcYcqxfcJExWBAt9) (truly the jewel of our hearts)
- [Ritz'n](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pAnsVtYr2xP3o8k38)
- the [vegan Bento/Restaurant place](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DkQhm2nQN4pAoGfg6)
- [Tsukuba Demi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qy6kLWZBRRZGiRff6) offers a vegan week **every two month** - check the [menu](https://kosei.sec.tsukuba.ac.jp/store/store_51)
- [Ayman ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CWSSvfbx4AfKLfAw5)curry, the takeaway is only 500yen
- [Doctor Pho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3q9fVMepCfWxZ2UN7) (closing down forever soon) or [King Pho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fTmPQxPaC83kKwKC9) for Vietnamese cuisine.

If you are going to try your luck in some restaurants without looking if they are offering food for you online, you should always ask them if the food is fine for you. Even if the menu says "Vegetable Soup" you might end up with seafood and meat in it (this happened to us). Sadly, communication can be a little hard sometimes, even if you speak Japanese, since a lot of people don't really understand what vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free really means. It might be helpful to bring [cards](https://justhungry.com/japan-dining-out-cards) to hand out to the restaurant staff that say that you are vegan/vegetarian or gluten-free. Sometimes you might still get seafood, even though you said you're vegetarian/ vegan. Luckily though, the staff is mostly always trying their best to make sure to get you the right food, but it might also happen that they can't get you any food at all since modifying (for example, leaving away the meat in the preparation) is not really a thing here.

If you are looking for processed food, a translator app with the function of image translation (e.g. Google Translator, Lens or DeepL) will be your best friend. The Kasumi at [iias](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6UtKr7XQfuhtUBf47) also has a vegan and gluten-free section. Welcia offers vegetarian dumplings, if you are craving that. [Is it Vegan (Japan)](https://isitveganjapan.com) is another great source for finding vegan Supermarket goods.

#### **Some more gluten-free advices:**

##### FOOD YOU CAN’T EAT even though it’s usually gluten-free:

* Mugichatea (made with barley)
* most Japanese sushi because they are made with beer vinegar
* Japanese Curry
* some Miso soups (sometimes wheat is used in the production)
* Soba (it’s buckwheat but sometimes mixed with wheat)

##### FOOD YOU CAN EAT in konbini:

* Salmon onigiri (always)
* Seaweed onigiri sometimes
* Tuna and mayo onigiri sometimes
* mochi
* Bean dango
* Fruit and vegetables
* some chips (the simplest ones, with only salt)
* Fries and oven potatoes
* some chicken skewers (the ones that only use salt)

Always check the ingredients, even if you only want to eat chips or usually gluten-free food because soy sauce is everywhere. It's best if you bring a lot of your own food from home. In Japan, they often don’t know what gluten is and that some people are allergic to it. In general, avoid any type of sauce and avoid eating out in restaurants as much as possible. Indian (curry) and Vietnamese restaurants (pho and many rice noodles with no soy sauce) will be a place where you'll find something for sure. You can also try to order gluten-free food online.

## Navigation 

[Japan Travel by NAVITIME](https://japantravel.navitime.com/en/) is by far the best way to navigate through Japan, especially for longer distances, but usually [Google Maps](https://www.google.de/maps/) will fulfill most of your needs. As a further alternative, [Rome2Rio](https://www.rome2rio.com) will help you a lot with finding additional public transport. For going by bike from A to B, Google Maps will also be enough, just take the walking option since there is (as of early 2024) no bike routing option. If you can walk the road, you can also bike it, and there will be a sidewalk you'll be allowed to drive on. If you want handpicked biking routes, you should also have a look at [Bikemap](https://www.bikemap.net/en/l/2110683/) and for hiking trails, you might have a look at [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/de/japan/ibaraki/tsukuba-shi).

When going from Tsukuba to Narita airport, use the [direct bus](https://japanbusonline.com/en/CourseSearch/10800060001) from Tsukuba Center Platform 8 (it won't be displayed on Google Maps).

When taking the Tsukuba Express Train to Tokyo, you should have a lookout for the rather hidden Ticket Vending machines, which sell tickets for a slightly lower price. They are located throughout Tsukuba. The easiest one to find should be [this one](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qB9JvshLSZQW5UzF6) at the bus stop. Tickets will be even more discounted if you go on weekends and holidays.

[Willer Express](https://willerexpress.com/en/) offers Night buses to destinations that are further away from Tokyo/Tsukuba. It will be one of the cheapest options for traveling. Willer is not the only company that offers cheap night buses, but it's probably the one that offers the most.

The easiest way for taking trains and buses is with an IC card, since you won't need to get a ticket every time you go somewhere. For a while now, it's not possible to get a physical Suica Card that easily. IPhone users can get a digital Suica (or alternative) via an app, more about that [here](https://blog.gaijinpot.com/how-to-use-a-mobile-ic-app/). Sadly, Android users who haven't purchased their phone in Japan can't do that. As for now, you can get a ToICa Card at [Tokyo Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rAuk1r8v9yw1HRVC6) you can get it at the JR Tokai Ticket Office (next to the Yaesu North Exit). More ticket counters [here](https://toica.jr-central.co.jp/counter/index.html).

**Bonus:** Always carry a notebook with you because each station has its own stamp!

## Accommodation

Finding hotels, hostels and other forms of accommodations is basically the same as everywhere else. We usually used [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/), [Booking](https://www.booking.com/), [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) and [Hostelz](https://www.hostelz.com/). But you might also want to have a look at [Jalan](https://www.jalan.net/) ([EN](https://www.jalan.net/en/japan_hotels_ryokan/)) and [Rakuten Travel](https://travel.rakuten.co.jp/) ([EN](https://travel.rakuten.com/?scid=wi_trv_specialbanner)) which are native to Japan. Mostly the prices don't differ much from the other Websites we listed, but occasionally, you can find prices that are a bit cheaper or offer more for the same price. Some say, that the English versions of the websites list less than the Japanese versions, but in our experience, this wasn't the case.

## Nightlife 

Every Friday at about 9 or 10 p.m., a lot of Students go to Bar Progress and the Konbinis near the bar. Usually the [7/11](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mdGLWVAAaSibeHr9A) will be the hot spot at first until the crowd moves to [Lawson100 ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kCVKatNJGTftH5VB8)or [Bar Progress](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mV1J5VyQANGJBJmj9). If you go to the meetings of Omichi Club and stick around with them, you'll end up there automatically.

**The "Red Light District"**

If you head further south from Bar Progress next to Matsumi Park, you'll arrive at what we call the red light district. It contains a lot of Izekayas, Bars and Karaoke and has it's own kind of flair.

- Karaoke: (For Karaoke it kinda doesn't really matter here you go, since most of them all have the same selection of songs to sing. )
  - [ラオケ ボイス](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9BP1KEPxzSTj794Y9) [Karaoke Voice] - One of the cheapest
  - [BigEcho](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EKE9J1P5sa5P5Ckv5) (fancier, but also a little more expensive):
- Nightclubs
  - [Octobass](https://maps.app.goo.gl/opdtyEid7VeNRLmN8) plays all kinds of stuff, better look at the [schedule](https://www.octbass.info)
  - [Frog](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uZcgwwSs4bnLAPdo6) is usually a bar that sometimes transforms into a live house - [schedule](https://frogtsukuba.jp)
  - [Parkdiner ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b8pp1RKmYKrXpp2LA)is another live house, that focuses more on rock music - [schedule](https://parkdiner.jp/schedule/)

**Finding Events** (not just in Tsukuba)

- [Tokyo Gig Guide](https://www.tokyogigguide.com/en/gigs) shows you a variety of upcoming events reaching from Jazz to Punk-Rock
- [Resident Advisor](https://ra.co/events/jp/tokyo) focuses more on electronic music, but also lets you see more events than just the ones in Tokyo
- [Tokyo Love District](https://tokyolovedistrict.com/category/events/) provides kinky events as well as a lot of other information about sex stuff in Japan
- If you want to see some good Punk concerts, the Instagram page [OsakaPunkRockGigsScheduleGuide](https://www.instagram.com/osakapunkrockgigsscheduleguide/) is the perfect start
- [A guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/14sum76/how_to_access_live_music_in_japan_and_why_it/) on finding live music in Japan

## Get a haircut 

Here in Japan, I*(Valeria)* had a drastic haircut, I recommend it to you too. Here are some salons where I cut my hair:

* [Poco A Poco Hair Salon ](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gtTAt3chnYt6n8dq5)| Cut: 18€
* [L by RLG](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kgQeqxHDsc5TSS2H7) | CUT and shampoo 30 euros.
* There is also a hairdresser inside the [Ichinoya Community Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n3xQPckfBanRhPXj6), but we haven’t been there yet.

* Tsukuba is most famous for being the headquarters of the Japanese space agency JAXA. You can find their obsession about space everywhere, from manhole covers to even the mascot of the University of Tsukuba. But don’t confuse the JAXA Space Center with the **[Tsukuba Expo Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NN78SiYUzT5a8eDu5)**, that also features a big rocket in front of its building, but is more aimed to teach science to kids in an interactive way.
